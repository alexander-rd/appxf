**Situation and Problems.** An application maintains sensible information for which you want to apply access restrictions, not relying on a particular operating system setup. Additionally, the application may need server access but you do not want to expose the credentials to the user. In both case, you also do not want to store this information on disk without encryption.

**Feature.** Upon first usage, the user sets a password and the application requires the password to run. APPXF maintains a symmetric encryption key with this password and enables a secure storage.
