If a feature is visible for final applications, it needs:
* documentation (updates) in the feature section
* automated BDD testing for behavior (application harness)
* manual test for user experience (application harness GUI)
* reference usage
	* documentation
	* testing the exact code in the testing
* All bullet points below since it is always also a feature for application developers
