# ToDo
 * finalize the LICENSE on root
	 * check references on how such "dual"/"combined" licensing can be written
 * branch_close: the gh create command (and likely the update may be frozen in a selection or not able to succeed)
	 * script should ensure that the (current) branch is clean (reuse from branch_open)
	 * script should catch errors, quit executing and printing them
