# ToDo
 * scan comments in source files
 * Last things before merge:
	 * rename the last kiss_cf in the actions
 * Ticket to review TODO remarks (at a very later point): some are only meaningful for me and some are outdated. Best would be to cover them by tickets.
 * Write README and add license

# After Merge
* I need to move the tickets AND update the TODO remarks which mention them
# Others / Triage
