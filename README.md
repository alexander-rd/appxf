# APPXF
APPXF covers an application's (APP) cross-functional concerns (XF), such as
settings, data sharing, logging, and secure storage, to reduce effort when
writing desktop applications.

## What it is
As of February 2026, around three years of hobbyist development
have been transferred into this public repository. It is *working code* that is
used in an application for a small association. While there are several usable
components, the *interfaces are unstable* and there is *no consistent
documentation*.

## It may become
APPXF may help close a gap when writing applications for
small associations or non-profits. Development will continue with the clear
understanding that one person’s free time cannot accomplish everything.

## Appreciation is Welcome
If you find any part of this library useful, the currently most efficient acknowledgement and motivation would be shareíng your story and project as a [discussion topic](https://github.com/alexander-nbg/appxf/discussions/new?category=show-and-tell) (example: [the app which initialized APPXF](https://github.com/alexander-nbg/appxf/discussions/10)). Additionally, while APPXF will not suddenly clean up all open topics or guarantee interface stability for relevant features, efforts are continuously prioritized based on the information available.

## Contributions Welcome
