:thumbsup: ***Yes, please.***

Just get in touch by commenting a ticket, opening a new one or dropping an Email (see my profile). Currently, I prefer some chat and discussion before reviewing a pull request. There are also no guidelines prepared, yet.

As soon as there is any interest, I will prioritize supporting the supporters.. ..just let me know.
