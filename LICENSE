Applying licenses is currently in progress (issue #1)

The APPXF project uses the following licenses:
 * Apache-2.0 (Apache License 2.0)
 * 0BSD (BSD Zero Clause License)
with license texts available in LICENSES/*.

The licensing applies the the following guideline:
 * Apache 2.0 for [src, tests, tests_features] folders: Python sources and tranlation PO files use Apache-2.0
 * 0BSD for [.github, doc, scripts]: General scripts, CI automation and documentation
 while each file clearly indicates it's license.
