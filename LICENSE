The APPXF project applies either
  * Apache-2.0 (Apache License 2.0) OR
  * 0BSD (BSD Zero Clause License)
with license texts available in the LICENSES subfolder. There is no default
license for any file. Each file specifies it's applicable license using SPDX
tags. Files for which license tags are not available, are listed below.

The following guideline applies while the specification for each file remains
binding:
 * Apache 2.0 for [src, tests, tests_features] folders with python source files
   and tranlation PO files.
 * 0BSD for [.github, doc, scripts] with general scripts, CI automation and
   documentation.
