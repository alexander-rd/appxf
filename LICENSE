 * TODO: where to indicate license when files cannot contain them

The APPXF project uses the following licenses:
 * Apache-2.0 (Apache License 2.0)
 * 0BSD (BSD Zero Clause License)
with license texts available in the LICENSES subfolder.

There is no default license and each file indicates the applicable license using SPDX tags. The following guideline applies:
 * Apache 2.0 for [src, tests, tests_features] folders with python source files and tranlation PO files.
 * 0BSD for [.github, doc, scripts] with general scripts, CI automation and documentation.
